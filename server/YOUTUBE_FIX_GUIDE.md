# YouTube Download Fix Guide

The "Could not extract functions" error is a common issue with ytdl-core when YouTube makes changes to their player code. This guide will help you fix the issue.

## Quick Fix

1. Run the fix script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x fix.sh
   ./fix.sh
   ```

2. Restart the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## What This Fix Does

1. **Improves URL Handling**:
   - Extracts video ID and creates clean URLs
   - Handles URLs with additional parameters like "si"

2. **Adds Better Error Handling**:
   - Provides detailed error messages
   - Adds fallback options when data is missing

3. **Adds Browser-like Headers**:
   - Uses proper User-Agent and Accept-Language headers
   - Helps bypass some YouTube restrictions

## Advanced Fix (For Persistent Issues)

If you continue to have issues, you can install youtube-dl-exec as a fallback:

1. Install the additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install youtube-dl-exec@2.4.17
   ```

2. Install youtube-dl on your system:
   - On macOS: `brew install youtube-dl`
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install youtube-dl`
   - On Windows: Download from https://youtube-dl.org/

3. Edit server.js to uncomment the youtube-dl-exec code (look for comments in the file)

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Try a different YouTube URL
2. Check the server logs for specific error messages
3. Make sure you have the latest version of ytdl-core
4. Consider using a different library or approach for YouTube downloads

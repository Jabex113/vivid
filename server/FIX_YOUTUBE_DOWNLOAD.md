# Fix for YouTube Download Issues

The "Could not extract functions" error is a common issue with ytdl-core when YouTube makes changes to their player code. This fix implements a fallback mechanism using youtube-dl-exec when ytdl-core fails.

## Steps to Fix

1. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install ytdl-core-discord@1.3.1 youtube-dl-exec@2.4.17
   ```

2. **Replace the server.js file**:
   ```bash
   mv server.js.new server.js
   ```

3. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## What This Fix Does

1. **Uses Multiple Libraries**: 
   - Tries ytdl-core first
   - Falls back to youtube-dl-exec if ytdl-core fails

2. **Improved URL Handling**:
   - Extracts video ID and creates clean URLs
   - Handles URLs with additional parameters

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Provides detailed error messages
   - Offers fallback options when primary methods fail

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Update youtube-dl-exec**:
   ```bash
   npm install youtube-dl-exec@latest
   ```

2. **Check for youtube-dl updates**:
   youtube-dl-exec uses youtube-dl under the hood, which may need to be updated separately on your system.

3. **Try a different video URL**:
   Some videos may have restrictions that prevent downloading.

## Note

This solution uses youtube-dl-exec as a fallback, which requires youtube-dl to be installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using:

- **On macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install youtube-dl
  ```

- **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install youtube-dl
  ```

- **On Windows**:
  Download from https://youtube-dl.org/ and add it to your PATH.
